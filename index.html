      <h1>Crimes My Bunnies Have Commited Around The House</h1>
      <p>and trust me, they are surprisingly destructive</p>
         </header>
     </article>

      <h2>The Culprits:</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Cinnabun</li>
            <img src="images/Bunbun.jpg" alt="Picture of Cinnabun" 
            style = width:200px;height:auto;/>
            <p>Our first bunny. <br>
               An impulse adoption after my partner and I finished our last English exam EVER!<br>
               Regrets? No. <br>
               Is she a menace? Absolutely.<br>
            </p>
            <br><br>
         <li>Egg</li>
            <img src = "images/Egg.jpg" alt="Picture of Egg"
            style = width:200px; height=auto;/>
            <p>
            Our foster failure<br> 
            He was found outside, either dumped or escaped<br>
            He came to us with a horrible case of ear mites so we think he's nearly deaf (or really, he just likes ignoring us)<br>
            But now, he is a spoiled little brat 
            </p>
            <br><br> 
         <li>Bobo</li>
         <img src = "images/Bobo.JPEG" alt="Picture of Bobo"
            style = width:200px; height=auto;/>
            <p>
            Another foster failure<br>
            The fluffiest of all, and seems to have no thoughts behind those eyes.<br>
            The truth? Oh he's planning something alright<br>
            </p>
            <br><br>
       </ul>
       <article>  
       <h2>The Victims:</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>Charger cable</li>
         <img src = "images/Broken wii cable.jpeg" alt="Chewed up cable"
         style = width:200px; height=auto;/>
            <p>aka "Spicy hay for bunnies", How they have not gotten electrical burns is beyond me<br>
               We have bought so many replacements that we firmly believe Amazon should consider sponsoring us
            </p>
         <br><br>
         <li>Carpet</li>
         <img src = "images/Chewed up carpet.jpeg" alt="Chewed up carpet"
         style = width:200px; height=auto;/>
            <p>Probably one of the reasons why I am in this program in hopes to get a higer paying job ---<br>
               Carpet repair!
            </p>
         <br><br>
         <li>Boxspring</li>
         <img src = "images/our poor boxspring.jpeg" alt="boxspring"
         style = width:200px; height=auto;/>
            <p> HUH?! WHY?! What did the boxspring ever do to you?<br>
               ** With some bonus chew marks on the bookshelf **
            </p>
         <br><br>
       </ul>
